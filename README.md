NooSphere
=========
NooSphere is a generic Activity-Centric computing infrastructures that can be used to develop and deployd distributed User Interfaces using activities as distributed data model. The infrastructure encapsulates basic distributed features into ActivityManagers or Nodes that support:

1. **File and data management**, by integrating into the native file system and supporting a distributed data model through NoSQL storage exposed through a REST API.
2. **Event propagation**, by providing a integrated web socket system for real-time events and messagging.
3. **Context tracking** (e.g. location), by supporting a context processor that communicates over REST or UDP.
4. **Discovery and pairing**, using both WSDiscovery and Bonjour as well as a dynamic web service mechanism.

#Usage
NooSphere runs in its own service host (powered by Owin) and can thus be added and deployed on any type of application or machine. This allows developers to easily launch and destroy activity managers:


```
class ExampleCode
    {

        static ActivitySystem activitySystem;
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            //Create a user
            var user = new User
            {
                Name = "Steven"
            };

            //Create a device
            var device = new Device
            {
                DeviceType = DeviceType.Desktop,
                DevicePortability = DevicePortability.Stationary,
                Owner = user
            };


            //create databaseconfiguration
            var databaseConfiguration = new DatabaseConfiguration("127.0.0.1", 8080, "test");

            //create activitysystem: this is the main component that provides an activity-
            //centric wrapper over a pure datastore. This system cam be used by the UI
            //directly through events or be exposed to a REST service using the activityservice
            //and accessed on other devices by using the activityclient
            activitySystem = new ActivitySystem(databaseConfiguration,false) { Device = device };

            //add handlers to the system for local UI support.
            activitySystem.ActivityAdded+=activitySystem_ActivityAdded;
            activitySystem.DeviceAdded += activitySystem_DeviceAdded;
            activitySystem.UserAdded += activitySystem_UserAdded;

            //Start a activityservice which wraps an activity system into a REST service
            var activityService = new ActivityService(activitySystem, "127.0.0.1", 8060);
            activityService.Start();

            //make the system discoverable on the LAN
            activityService.StartBroadcast(DiscoveryType.Zeroconf, "activitySystem", "mycompany","1234");

            activitySystem.StartLocationTracker();
            activitySystem.Tracker.TagEnter += Tracker_TagEnter;

            //Wait for one second to allow the service to start
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            //Use the discoverymanager to find the activityservice and connect to it
            //using an activityclient. This should be used to connect to the
            //activity system from a different device.
            var disco = new DiscoveryManager();

            disco.DiscoveryAddressAdded += (sender, e) =>

                //Note that you don't have to use discovery but can connect directly
                //if you know the IP
                var activityClient = new ActivityClient(foundWebConfiguration.Address, foundWebConfiguration.Port, device);
